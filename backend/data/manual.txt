Automobile Diagnostics Manual (Simplified)

1. ENGINE_COOLANT_TEMP: Normal < 90°C. If higher, check coolant and cooling system.

2. FUEL_LEVEL: Fuel level less than 20 is a lower limit. Normal 0-100%. Above 90% means tank nearly full.

3. ENGINE_LOAD: Normal 0-100%. If > 90%, check air filter and sensors.

4. ENGINE_RPM: Idle normal > 750 RPM. If lower, risk of stalling.

5. INTAKE_MANIFOLD_PRESSURE: Normal 10-20 kPa at idle. If > 18 kPa, check for leaks.

6. MAF: Normal 2-7 g/s at idle. If > 3.5 g/s, check for leaks or faulty sensor.

7. TIMING_ADVANCE: Normal 0-40% at idle. If > 60%, check timing system.

8. EQUIV_RATIO: Normal 0.9-1.1. If < 0.9, check for leaks and sensors.

9. DTC_NUMBER: Any code needs investigation.

10. THROTTLE_POS: Normal 0-100%. If > 19% at idle, check throttle system.

11. AIR_INTAKE_TEMP: Normal up to 32°C. If higher, check airflow and cooling.

12. SPEED: Should be 0 when stationary. If not, check sensors.

13. ENGINE_RUNTIME: Shows how long engine has run.

14. Short Term Fuel Trim Bank 1: Normal -10% to +10%. If > 5%, check for leaks and fuel system.

Advice: Regular maintenance helps. For persistent issues, seek professional help.

Below this , we will be adding Alerts and Processed Data tables in that order
Each row in processed data represents 4s. If some one asks what's the maximum engine temperature in last 20seconds, then you look at last 5 rowas , as each row is 4s and give the maximum engine temperature in those 5 rows. 

If they ask for what is the latest alert , then you look for the last row in Alerts and respond that. 

When asked for latest or current engine temperature or fuel left , asnwer from processed Data and not alerts table.
